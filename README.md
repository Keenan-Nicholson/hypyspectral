# HyPyspectral

HyPyspectral is a work in progress Python-based tool designed to perform analysis of hyperspectral imagery by extracting important spectral indices and statistical metrics.

## Incoming Features

- Extraction of vegetation indices and other spectral metrics.
- Computation of statistical descriptors for each pixel.
- Extract information from input area (bounding box, kml/kmz)

## Vegetation Indices

HyPyspectral will support the computation of the following commonly used vegetation indices:

- **NDVI** (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)
- **EVI** (Enhanced Vegetation Index)
- **SAVI** (Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index)
- **OSAVI** (Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index)
- **ARVI** (Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index)
- **MSAVI** (Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index)
- **GCI** (Green Chlorophyll Index)
- **RVI** (Ratio Vegetation Index)
- **DVI** (Difference Vegetation Index)
- **NDWI** (Normalized Difference Water Index)
- **NDSI** (Normalized Difference Snow Index)
- **NBR** (Normalized Burn Ratio)
- **BSI** (Bare Soil Index)
- **NDRE** (Normalized Difference Red Edge)

## Statistical Metrics

HyPyspectral will also calculates the following statistical features for each pixel:

- **Mean**
- **Median**
- **Mode**
- **Variance**
- **Standard Deviation**
- **Range** (Max - Min)
- **Skewness**
- **Kurtosis**
- **Percentiles** (25th, 50th, 75th)
- **Entropy**
